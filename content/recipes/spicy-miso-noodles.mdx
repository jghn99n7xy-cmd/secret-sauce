## Quick intro
These noodles are salty-sweet, spicy, and ridiculously fast. Perfect when you want real flavor with zero fuss.

## Ingredients
- 6 oz noodles (ramen, udon, or spaghetti)
- 1 tbsp miso
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1–2 tsp chili crisp
- 1 tsp honey or sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- Optional: scallions, sesame seeds, soft-boiled egg

## Steps
1. Cook noodles according to package directions. Reserve a splash of noodle water.
2. Mix miso, soy sauce, chili crisp, honey, and garlic in a bowl.
3. Toss noodles with sauce. Loosen with a little noodle water if needed.
4. Top with scallions/sesame/egg and eat immediately.

## Notes
- No chili crisp? Use sriracha + a drizzle of oil.
- Add spinach or bok choy in the last minute of boiling.
